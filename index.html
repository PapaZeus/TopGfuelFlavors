              Look, let me start off with I am a pretty big grapefruit fan to begin with, but I can assure you this definitely has enough flavor for anyone to enjoy! It's not bitter like you would expect in a regular grapefruit. G Fuel really hit the nail on the head with the balance between sweet and bitter. Whether you're a grapefruit lover or not, you can't go wrong with this bad boy!

              This flavor, to my suprise, was fruity in all the right ways. I thought it would be just another knockoff fruit mixture, but it actually has a good, refrshing taste to it. Plus, the turquoise blue just looks fantasic in your shaker. Try this flavor if you're big into cold, refreshing fruits and juices. Big ups to this flavor.

              Now let me start off with this flavor is not terrible, but I wouldn't say I would recommend it either..It has a good taste going in, but the after taste for me is a bit of a turn off. It leaves kind of a chalky taste in your mouth, ya know? Now, unless you're into that..you have found the flavor for you, but otherwise I would steer clear of this little guy. By all means, try it if you're curious, but don't say I didn't warn you.

      <h6 id="center">*Little disclaimer* First off, these are soley my opinions on said flavors, I am in no way responsible if you for some reason do not like the flavor...take that up with G Fuel.<br><br><i>PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE</i> use <strong>ICE</strong> with your G Fuel. It's sooooooo much better with ice. I made this mistake the first tub I bought of G Fuel. I tried it with ice later on, and maaaaan can you tell the difference in not only qualify but flavor. I told this to all my friends who use G Fuel and they also agree, so please, for the love of yourself..<strong>USE ICE WITH YOUR G FUEL.</strong><br><br><strong>ENJOY.</strong> This really is a great product and I hope this site not only makes your decision process easier, but can help you to enjoy what G Fuel truly has to offer as well.</h6> <br>
